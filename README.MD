##### Disclaimer

During this research I skipped following instances: closed registration *at the moment of checking*, running old code, theme / description not understood due to language barrier or scarce description, with long blocklists and strange block reasoning, experimental servers.

If I forgot to include your instance, don't take it personally. You can add themed instances by opening an issue or via [MR](https://gitlab.com/distributopia/masto-world-overview). If your instance already has many users, may be it would be wise to let other instances grow instead, for a healthier decentralization.

If you wish to be excluded from the list, kindly say so in issues.

##### Possible research to be made

- where instances are hosted (how many of them (%) are hosted on Amazon);
- how many instances (%) provide transparent info about silencing other instances, how many don't provide this information;
- which silenced instances are in blocklists often, which are personal preferences of some instance's admins.
